Assignment 1: In the Product Class, we initialise the following variables:
	      Name of Product, Net Price of product, and the count through the list of products.
	      In the Shop Class, we initiliaze the methods to add products, print the stocklist of products, and print 
	      the combined net value of the products. 
	      The main class reads in a text file named 'shop.txt', which contains the stocklist. 
	      The product class provides the variables needed from the text file, and shop contains the methods needed
	      to give the net and gross value of the products
